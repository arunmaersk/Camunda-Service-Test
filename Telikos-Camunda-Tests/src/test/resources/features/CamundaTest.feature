  @test1
  Scenario Outline: To test the camunda happy flow for Intermodal
    Given a user start the workflow with "<servicePlanNumber>","<bookingId>","<logisticId>","<productCode>","<productName>"
    Then the status code should be "<statusCode>"
    When user hit the VerifyCurrentRunningStatus api to fetch the process instance id with "<businessKey>"
    And verify the booking variable details for "<bookingVariable_Name>" "<captureDataStatus>" "<validationMessage>" "<servicePlanNumber>" "<bookingId>" "<logisticId>" "<variableValue>"
    And verify the domainTaskRules variable details "<domainTaskRulesVariable_Name>" "<variableValue>"
    And verify the capture variable details "<captureVariable_Name>" "<captureFlag>"
    And verify the preCapture variable details "<preCaptureVariable_Name>" "<preCaptureFlag>"
    When user hit the validation api to resume the workflow with "<servicePlanNumber>","<bookingId>","<logisticId>","<productCode>","<productName>"
    Then verify the current task running status is "<firstManualIntervention_TaskName>"
    When user hit the fulfilment api to resume the workflow with "<servicePlanNumber>","<bookingId>","<logisticId>","<productCode>","<productName>"
    And user verify all the completed task
